# Serene Touch Care Services - Refactored Website

This repository contains the refactored version of the Serene Touch Care Services website. The original WordPress/Elementor website has been converted to clean, standalone HTML and CSS files.

## What Was Refactored

### Original Issues

- The original file was a complex WordPress/Elementor site with over 3,500 lines
- Inline CSS scattered throughout the HTML
- Heavy JavaScript dependencies (emoji support, Elementor framework, etc.)
- WordPress-specific markup and classes
- Multiple external CSS and JS file dependencies

### Refactoring Process

1. **CSS Extraction**: All inline styles were extracted and organized into a single `styles.css` file
2. **HTML Cleanup**: Removed WordPress/Elementor-specific elements while preserving the visual design
3. **JavaScript Simplification**: Replaced complex WordPress JS with minimal, modern JavaScript for essential functionality
4. **Structure Optimization**: Converted to semantic HTML5 structure with proper sections and navigation
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Added responsive design improvements for better mobile experience

  /* ... other colors */
}
```

### Adding New Content

The HTML is structured with semantic sections:

**Homepage (index.html):**

- `<header>` - Navigation and contact info
- `<section id="home">` - Hero section
- `<section id="about">` - About section
- `<section id="services">` - Services grid
- `<footer>` - Footer with links and contact

**Contact Page (contact.html):**

- `<header>` - Same navigation structure
- `<section class="page-title">` - Page title section
- `<section class="contact-section">` - Contact form and details
- `<section class="map-section">` - Embedded map location
- `<footer>` - Same footer structure

### Modifying Styles

All styles are in `styles.css` organized by component:

- Reset and base styles
- Layout components
- Individual sections (header, hero, services, footer)
- Responsive design
- Animations

## Contact Form

The contact page includes a fully functional contact form with:

- Client-side validation
- Success/error message handling
- Responsive design
- Form submission ready for backend integration

To integrate with a backend service, replace the form submission logic in the `handleFormSubmit()` function in `contact.html`.
